nt|jgc: Good afternoon all this should be an entertaining match|pg||
nt|kareno: JC :)|pg||
nt|ahollan1: pre-alert for NS   1@C = 2+  and when BAL can have ANY 5-card suit  including (542)2@C|pg||
nt|kareno: In my opinion, long matches are more often determined by who gets the better of the part score hands.  Those 5,6,7 IMPs add up.|pg||
mb|1C|mb|1H|nt|kareno: It's 9 am in Vegas, noon in D.C.|pg||
nt|kareno: I'm asked why not pre dealt hands yesterday - |pg||
mb|2C!|nt|jgc: acbl judges that security is better if each match has its own bords, right or wrong|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 2@C = 5+@D|pg||
nt|kareno: Folks, there are already some 500 of you and only a few commentators.  Please hold comments and questions to only a few!!|pg||
mb|p|nt|kareno: So, transfer advances in competition, interesting.|pg||
mb|2D|mb|2H|mb|3D|mb|3H|nt|jgc: Yes, and very effective here|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|nt|kareno: Good result for Fleisher in the CR where they were allowed to play 2@h.  This is one of those part score hands I was talking about.|pg||
pc|d9|nt|ahollan1: warning:  in other room grue-moss play TWO systems   non-vul = precision   vul they call system 2/1 relay  [but most 2-level responses artificial]|pg||

nt|jgc: Altho' I can see E/W getting too high|pg||
mb|p|mb|1N|mb|p|mb|2C!|mb|p|mb|2D|nt|kareno: But note the first board, a partscore swing, produced 5 IMPs, half of a game swing.|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 2@C is a modified checkback|pg||
mb|p|mb|3S|nt|jgc: Aker showing the proper lack of respect for the opening bid|pg||
nt|ahollan1: oh  this is one of the simson-aker differences from meckwell     our EW play 2-way checkback so 2@C forces 2@D  a) to play  b) some INV|pg||
nt|ahollan1: i will try to work from notes rather than flawed memory|pg||
nt|ahollan1: NOT official notes -- just stuff i've built up|pg||
nt|kareno: I'll take Al's memory over mine any day on systems!!|pg||
nt|ahollan1: there MUST be a 3rd option Karen|pg||
mb|p|mb|3N|nt|kareno: Nope - unless you allow the players at the table a microphone to comment on their systems.|pg||
nt|jgc: The third option is to actually have a convention card|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|nt|jgc: Al, was 3@S forcing?|pg||
nt|kareno: Without a heart lead, this has prospects!!  |pg||
nt|ahollan1: nope  2@C can be COG [choice of game] but only if rebid is 3N   otherwise INV|pg||
nt|jgc: And Sison bid on with that piece of cheese...|pg||
nt|jgc: Simson, sorry Doug|pg||
pc|s3|pc|sK|pc|sA|pc|s7|pg||
nt|kareno: There's a lot of theory about leading majors against notrump and I remember  a lesson from Paul Heitner about leading 'the unbid major.'  Spade lead probably my last choice here.|pg||
pc|c8|pc|c7|pc|cJ|pc|c4|pg||
nt|kareno: The theory discusses the benefits of leading majors - JC?  Your thoughts on this?|pg||
nt|ahollan1: Karen - aren't you making a huge underbid with "probably my last choice"?|pg||
nt|ahollan1: surely you hide @S suit then try to figure out what to lead from remaining cards|pg||
nt|kareno: I'm trying to be polite, Al.|pg||
nt|jgc: I'm with Heitner...unless I have a good lead in another suit. Here, a @H bis my choice. A @S would be my 10th thru 13th choices|pg||
nt|kareno: Roy Welland has a very good sniffer - he finds some amazing leads.  However, this time, not so amazing.|pg||
nt|ahollan1: speaking of "The Whale"   i hope everyone knows that Jeff Rubens has published a compilation of ALL issues of the great but long defunct Bridge Journal|pg||
pc|s9|pc|sQ|pc|h2|pc|s4|pg||
nt|ahollan1: the Bridge Journal had a menagerie different from Mollo's     Heitner was "The Whale", Rubens "The Snail"  and hopefully Karen can remember the other members of the zoo|pg||
pc|sJ|pc|d4|pc|d5|pc|s2|pg||

pc|d4|nt|kareno: Would anyone consider a forcing nt with that south disaster?|pg||

nt|ahollan1: 1N overcall should include weaker hands [nv: 14]|pg||
nt|ahollan1: of course  Kaplan's opponent's had more hcp when they opened|pg||

mb|1C!|mb|p|mb|1S!|mb|p|nt|ahollan1: 1@C = 2+@C  if BAL can have ANY 5-card suit  [including (542)2@C]|pg||

mb|2N!|mb|p|nt|ahollan1: 1N = BAL   go figure|pg||

mb|p|mb|3H!|nt|ahollan1: 1N could still be 17-19|pg||

mb|d|nt|ahollan1: pass or 4@C?|pg||
nt|vugraphzfk: Welland told Aker 0-1|pg||
nt|ahollan1: moysian seems ugly choice since @H taps in hand with long trump|pg||
nt|ahollan1: thanks  i always wondered if 3-suiter could be 544|pg||
nt|kareno: But might be the only choice.  |pg||
nt|jgc: But with @S 3-3 and @SK onside...|pg||
mb|4C|mb|p|mb|4D|mb|p|mb|5C|mb|p|nt|jgc: 3NT has virtually no chance with a @H lead coming. At least 4@S and 5@C have a slim chance|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|kareno: Certainly better than 3nt.  5@c runs into annoying 4-1 club break.|pg||
pc|hJ|nt|ahollan1: i wonder if legal in partnership to pass 4@C|pg||
nt|jgc: Yes, the 4-1 may well beat it after @H ruffs in dummy|pg||
nt|kareno: When I played with Paul Heitner, GF included 'q-game' quasi game of 4 of a minor passable.|pg||
nt|ahollan1: ahhhh i still see some references to FGQ  never realized Q = quasi  but have correctly figured out  3N/4x|pg||
nt|jgc: Most of us are more literal than Whale|pg||
nt|kareno: I am except in one partnership.  |pg||
